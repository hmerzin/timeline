        <p id="p1">President Eisenhower delivered his Atoms for Peace speech at the United

Nations in 1953, and Nikita Khrushchev proposed talks on the subject in 

February 1955, paving the way for the establishment in 1957 of the 

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  The IAEA was tasked with 

promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy and establishing and 

administering safeguards to ensure that assistance provided by it, at its 

request, or under its supervision or control was not used in such a way as to 

further any military purpose.

      <p id="p2">In August of 1955, President Eisenhower announced that the United States would be willing, as part of a first-step disarmament agreement, to suspend nuclear explosive testing for up to two years under certain conditions and safeguards, including Soviet acceptance of the U.S. call for a permanent cessation of the production of fissionable materials for weapons purposes and the installation of inspection systems to ensure compliance.

      <p id="p3">In 1958, President Eisenhower proposed a Conference of Experts to examine the technical issues involved in verifying a nuclear explosive test ban.  These scientists determined that a comprehensive nuclear test ban could be verified through a network of 160 monitoring stations and that nuclear explosive tests in space could be verified out to 50 kilometers.</p>

    <div class="modal" id="modal5">
      <p id="p5">Technical and political limits on monitoring and verification continued to be at the forefront of international negotiations of a nuclear explosive testing ban.  In 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and President Eisenhower traded proposals concerning on-site control systems to monitor underground detonations, prohibitions on atmospheric tests, and negotiations over the control of underground and outer space tests. </p>
